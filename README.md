# project.0002.Pavers
Documentation for my concrete pavers

2018.11.02

This project is inspired by the following YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmB53SMQR60) by HomeMadeModern (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6pdMJwtkbCNoQRwbaNt77A).  I designed several versions that mimic Japanese fishscale patterns. These designs will be 3-D printed and then used to make concrete moulds.
